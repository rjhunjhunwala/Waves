# Waves

Using numerical methods to approximate the second order partial differential wave equation, which can be state as follows.

The second derivative with respect to time of the height, is directly proportional to the spatial laplace operator, i.e the divergence of the gradient. 

We allow the user to click on the screen to influence the simulation as it evolves.
